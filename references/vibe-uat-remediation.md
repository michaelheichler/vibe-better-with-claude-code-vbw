# VBW Vibe UAT Remediation

Loaded via `@${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/vibe-uat-remediation.md` from `commands/vibe.md` to run the `/vbw:vibe` UAT remediation stage machine.

## Entry, Stage Resolution, and Issue Ranking (VIBE-UAT-01)

**Guard:** Initialized, target phase has `*-UAT.md` with `status: issues_found`.

**Execution model:** This mode runs inline, the orchestrator manages stage transitions (steps 1-5) and spawns agents for the actual work within each stage (step 6). The three stages (research, plan, execute) are sequential steps of this conversation, not delegated tasks, do not decompose them into TaskCreate items.

**Chain state tracking:** This mode uses `/tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/scripts/uat-remediation-state.sh` to persist the current stage of the remediation chain on disk. This ensures correct resumption after compaction or session restart, the chain does NOT rely on prompt memory alone.

**Steps:**
1. Resolve target phase from pre-computed state (`next_phase`, `next_phase_slug`) when `next_phase_state=needs_uat_remediation`. Set `PHASE_DIR` to the resolved phase directory path.
   **Milestone path guard (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** If `PHASE_DIR` contains `.vbw-planning/milestones/` (e.g., `.vbw-planning/milestones/*/phases/`), STOP, this is an archived milestone. UAT Remediation operates only on active phases in `.vbw-planning/phases/`. Display: "⚠ UAT issues found in archived milestone, not active phases. Routing to Milestone UAT Recovery." Then route to Milestone UAT Recovery mode instead.
2. Read the active UAT artifact exactly once. Use `uat_file` from the pre-computed state when available. It is phase-relative to `PHASE_DIR` (for example `03-UAT.md` or `remediation/uat/round-01/R01-UAT.md`). If `uat_file=none` or the computed path does not exist, resolve the active UAT artifact from `PHASE_DIR` with one deterministic fallback (current round-dir UAT first, phase-root fallback). If no active UAT artifact exists, STOP and display: "⚠ Phase {NN} routes to UAT remediation but no active UAT artifact could be found."
   **Single-read rule (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** Use that single UAT read as the source of truth for issue descriptions, severities, and current remediation scope. Do NOT shell out to `extract-uat-issues.sh` for active-phase routing.
   **Round-dir nuance:** At the start of a new remediation round, the active artifact may still be the latest previous-round UAT (for example step 4 returns `round=02` while the active file is `remediation/uat/round-01/R01-UAT.md`). That is expected, treat the artifact you read here as the current source report until a newer UAT exists.
3. Normalize the current issue list from the UAT read. For each failing test or discovered issue, capture `ID`, `SEVERITY`, and `DESCRIPTION`. Treat this normalized issue list as source-of-truth scope. Do NOT ask the user to restate issues already recorded in UAT.
4. **Resolve remediation stage (single call):**
   ```bash
   bash /tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/scripts/uat-remediation-state.sh get-or-init "$PHASE_DIR" "major"
   ```
   Use `major` when `uat_issues_major_or_higher=true`. Otherwise use `minor` for the initial entry call.
   **Run directly (do NOT capture with `$()`).**
   - Both resume and init paths emit **plan metadata** after the stage line:
     ```text
     round=RR: zero-padded current round number (e.g., 01)
     round_dir=<path>: absolute host-repository path to the round directory
     research_path=<path>: absolute host-repository path to existing RESEARCH.md (empty if none)
     plan_path=<path>: absolute host-repository path to existing PLAN.md (empty if none)
     summary_path=<path>: absolute host-repository path where SUMMARY.md must be written
     ```
     **Use these values directly:** do NOT glob `*-PLAN.md` or search for RESEARCH.md files. The script pre-computes all paths from the phase directory (with legacy phase-root fallback for brownfield projects).
    <uat_remediation_artifact_contract>
    `round_dir`, `research_path`, `plan_path`, and `summary_path` are absolute paths in the host repository. Claude Code may run subagents from `.claude/worktrees/agent-*` sidechain CWDs. Pass these exact paths to every Scout/Lead/Dev prompt and never rewrite them relative to the current CWD. Do not accept artifacts written under `.claude/worktrees/agent-*` as valid remediation artifacts.
    In migrated `layout=legacy` projects, non-empty `research_path` or `plan_path` may be an absolute phase-root artifact selected by `uat-remediation-state.sh`. Validate that exact metadata path directly instead of rewriting it to `round_dir` or searching for alternatives.
    </uat_remediation_artifact_contract>
    <uat_remediation_spawn_contract>
    The Research → Plan → Execute (or Fix) list is session progress tracking only. TodoWrite is the only progress tracker for these stages. Do not create or update stage-progress items with TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, or Agent. TaskCreate/Agent is allowed only for real Scout/Lead/Dev work-unit delegation inside the current stage, never to represent the stage list itself.
    UAT remediation spawns are plain sequential subagent calls. Do not form an agent team (do not spawn teammates). Use plain sequential subagent Agent calls.

Non-team invariant: omit `team_name`, `run_in_background`, `isolation`, and all worktree cwd fields.

Claude Code worktree isolation and spawn cwd handoffs are not reliable for this path. Exact absolute host paths keep the orchestrator and subagents on the same `.vbw-planning/.../remediation/uat/...` artifacts.
    </uat_remediation_spawn_contract>
    <examples>
    <example type="anti-pattern" label="WRONG, stage progress via delegated task manager">
    TaskCreate("Research Phase 03 UAT remediation") → TaskUpdate("Plan", completed) → TaskCreate("Execute") creates stage trackers outside the orchestrator's TodoWrite progress list.
    </example>
    <example type="correct" label="RIGHT, stage progress via TodoWrite">
    TodoWrite: Research=in-progress, Plan=not-started, Execute=not-started. After research validates, TodoWrite: Research=completed, Plan=in-progress, Execute=not-started.
    </example>
    <example type="correct" label="RIGHT, delegated Dev work unit">
    Spawn one Dev for the current plan task using the non-team spawn shape: omit `team_name`, `run_in_background`, `isolation`, and worktree cwd fields (`cwd`, `working_dir`, `workingDirectory`, `workdir`). `name` is optional label-only metadata. Never use it for routing, lifecycle state, or team semantics. Include absolute artifacts exactly as returned by state metadata:
    Plan: /repo/.vbw-planning/phases/03-example/remediation/uat/round-01/R01-PLAN.md
    Summary: /repo/.vbw-planning/phases/03-example/remediation/uat/round-01/R01-SUMMARY.md
    </example>
    </examples>
   - If a stage was already persisted (resume after compaction/restart), the script returns the stage word + plan metadata with no side effects.
   - If no stage existed (first entry into remediation), the script initializes the stage file, creates `remediation/uat/round-01/` directory, pre-seeds the phase `{NN}-CONTEXT.md`, and returns the stage word + plan metadata + `---CONTEXT---` separator with the full pre-seeded context content, **use this directly as your remediation context. Do NOT separately read UAT.md or `{NN}-CONTEXT.md` files.**
   - If the returned stage is `done`: UAT remediation already completed for this phase. Display "Remediation already completed. Run `/vbw:vibe` to re-verify." STOP.
    **TodoWrite progress list (NON-NEGOTIABLE ordering and state):** Immediately after resolving the stage, create a TodoWrite progress list with items in **exactly this order** for the major path: (1) Research, (2) Plan, (3) Execute. For the minor path: (1) Fix. **Item numbering must match stage order**, Research is always #1, Plan #2, Execute #3. Never reorder items. This is a progress display for the user, agent spawning for each stage is handled in the execution stage below. Do not represent Research, Plan, Execute, or Fix as TaskCreate/TaskUpdate items.
   - **Initial creation:** If the resolved stage is `research`, mark Research as in-progress, Plan and Execute as not-started. If the resolved stage is `plan` (resume case), mark Research as completed, Plan as in-progress, Execute as not-started. If `execute`, mark Research and Plan as completed, Execute as in-progress.
   - **Same-session progression:** When a stage completes and you advance to the next stage within the same session (e.g., research completes → advance → start plan), immediately update the TodoWrite progress list: mark the completed stage as completed and the new stage as in-progress. Do NOT defer updates or recreate the list from scratch.
   - **Final stage:** When the last stage completes, mark ALL TodoWrite items as completed before presenting the summary.
5. **Recurrence analysis and priority ranking:**
   Use `round=RR` from step 4 as the **current remediation round** for stage management.

   Derive `active_uat_round` from the single step-2 UAT artifact:
   - `remediation/uat/round-{NN}/R{NN}-UAT.md` → `active_uat_round={NN}`
   - phase-root `*-UAT.md` → the active report round at the phase root (round 1 when no archived round files exist. Otherwise the root report comes after the archived round files already on disk)

   **Important:** `active_uat_round` can be **less than `RR`** at the start of a new remediation round because the new round has no UAT yet. Do NOT assume the active UAT artifact belongs to the current remediation round.

   **Post-route enrichment:** When inspecting earlier archived UAT artifacts for recurrence, read only the archived artifacts for this phase (flat `*-UAT-round-*.md` or round-dir `remediation/uat/round-*/R*-UAT.md`) and **exclude the active step-2 UAT artifact itself from the scan**. Build `FAILED_IN_ROUNDS` from the matching archived rounds plus `active_uat_round`. If no earlier matches exist, default each current issue to `FAILED_IN_ROUNDS={active_uat_round}`, **never** default to `RR` when the active artifact is a previous-round UAT.

  **Phase-level escalation:** When `RR >= 3`, force ALL issues through `research → plan → execute` regardless of severity. If the persisted stage from step 4 is `fix`, replace the quick-fix TodoWrite progress list with the major-path TodoWrite progress list (`Research`, `Plan`, `Execute`) before continuing.

   **Per-test priority ranking:** Rank issues by `failure_count` descending, tests that failed the most recorded UAT rounds get investigated and fixed FIRST. When presenting issues to Scout (research stage) and Lead (plan stage), reorder by `failure_count` descending and annotate:
   - `⚠ RECURRING (failed in N recorded rounds): ID|SEVERITY|DESCRIPTION` for tests with `failure_count >= 2`
   - `ID|SEVERITY|DESCRIPTION` (no annotation) for first-time failures

   **Scout research prompt for recurring issues** MUST include: *"{ID} has failed in {N} recorded UAT rounds (rounds: {FAILED_IN_ROUNDS}). Current source artifact round: {active_uat_round}. Current remediation round: {RR}. Prior fixes have not resolved this. Investigate WHY previous fixes failed before proposing a new approach, examine the actual data flow, not just symptoms."*

   **Lead planning prompt for recurring issues** MUST include: *"Prioritize recurring failures. {ID} has failed in {N} recorded UAT rounds, allocate more plans/effort to this issue than to first-time failures."*

## Stage Execution Contract (VIBE-UAT-02)

Execute the current stage based on `STAGE`.

- **File read rule:** Do NOT re-read the active `{phase}-UAT.md` artifact unless step 5 requires earlier archived rounds for recurrence enrichment. Use the single step-2 UAT read as the active-round source of truth. If step 5 scans archived rounds, exclude that active artifact from the scan. Do NOT read `{phase}-CONTEXT.md`. Step 4 already emitted the remediation context when needed.
- **Round metadata prohibition:** Do NOT glob `*-PLAN.md`, search for `*-RESEARCH.md`, or infer summary locations. Use the pre-computed `round`, `round_dir`, `research_path`, `plan_path`, and `summary_path` values from step 4. If a subagent reports success but the deterministic validator below fails, treat the stage as incomplete and STOP without advancing state.
- **Subagent no-tool circuit breaker (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** At every UAT remediation Scout, Lead, or Dev subagent return site below, follow the no-tool circuit breaker in `references/subagent-contracts.md` before artifact validation, summary finalization, or `.uat-remediation-stage` advancement. If it triggers, STOP without advancing `.uat-remediation-stage` and report the failed subagent role and task.

No-tool invariant: treat unavailable tools as a provisioning failure, do not advance state, and do not retry the same prompt.

## Research Stage (VIBE-UAT-03)

If `research_path` from step 4 is non-empty, research already exists. Validate it before advancing:
```bash
bash /tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/scripts/validate-uat-remediation-artifact.sh research "{research_path}"
```
If validation fails, display the validator error and STOP without advancing state. Otherwise, skip to advancing the stage.

If `research_path` is empty, spawn Scout with these requirements:

- Set `subagent_type: "vbw:vbw-scout"`.
- Use the non-team spawn shape. Omit `team_name`, `run_in_background`, `isolation`, and worktree cwd fields (`cwd`, `working_dir`, `workingDirectory`, `workdir`). `name` is optional label-only metadata and must never be used for routing, lifecycle state, or team semantics.
- Pass the normalized issue list from steps 3-5, **ordered by failure_count descending**, so Scout investigates the relevant code areas for each issue.
- Use `round` from step 4 as `{RR}`.
- Pass `<output_path>{round_dir}/R{RR}-RESEARCH.md</output_path>` so Scout writes directly to the absolute host-repository round directory.
- Before composing the Scout task description, evaluate installed skills visible in your system context. Read each skill's description and select only skills directly needed for this research task. Do not include implementation, build, or adjacent domain skills solely because they might become useful in a later Lead or Dev stage.
- Begin the Scout prompt with exactly one explicit skill outcome block:
  - Use `<skill_activation>{For each selected skill: "Call Skill({skill-name})"}</skill_activation>` when one or more installed skills are preselected at orchestration time.
  - Use `<skill_no_activation>Evaluated installed skills for this task. No skills were preselected at orchestration time. Reason: {brief task-specific reason}.</skill_no_activation>` when none are preselected.
  - Silent omission of both blocks is invalid.
- State the skill outcome in your response before spawning the agent (for example, "Skills: activating {skill-name}" or "Skills: none preselected, {reason}").
- If the prompt or error mentions SwiftData and the research task requires SwiftData model semantics, include `swiftdata`. Do not include it only as a possible future implementation aid.
- After calling `Skill(...)`, read any specific additional files, sibling docs, or follow-up steps that the loaded skill identifies as relevant. Do not scan entire skill folders or read unrelated references.
- Evaluate available MCP tools in your system context. If an MCP server provides documentation, search, or data retrieval capabilities relevant to the issues, note it in the Scout task context so Scout prioritizes it over generic WebSearch or WebFetch.

If one or more skills were preselected, run `bash "{plugin-root}/scripts/extract-skill-follow-up-files.sh" "{all preselected skill names from the activation block}" 2>/dev/null || true` before spawning the UAT remediation research Scout. If the helper prints a `<skill_follow_up_files>` block, paste it immediately after the follow-up-read sentence in the spawned payload. Otherwise omit that block.

Use this payload prefix as the FIRST lines of the UAT remediation research Scout prompt:
```text
<skill_activation>
Call Skill('{relevant-skill-1}').
Call Skill('{relevant-skill-2}').
</skill_activation>
After calling `Skill(...)`, if the loaded skill's instructions reference additional files, sibling docs, or follow-up read steps relevant to the active task, read those specific files before reasoning or acting. Do not scan entire skill folders or read unrelated references.
<skill_follow_up_files>
{If one or more skills were preselected, run `bash "{plugin-root}/scripts/extract-skill-follow-up-files.sh" "{all preselected skill names from the activation block}" 2>/dev/null || true` before spawning and replace this block with the emitted absolute follow-up file paths. Omit this block when the helper prints nothing.}
</skill_follow_up_files>
```
When no installed skills apply, use this prefix instead:
```text
<skill_no_activation>
Evaluated installed skills for this task. No skills were preselected at orchestration time. Reason: {brief task-specific reason}.
</skill_no_activation>
After calling `Skill(...)`, if the loaded skill's instructions reference additional files, sibling docs, or follow-up read steps relevant to the active task, read those specific files before reasoning or acting. Do not scan entire skill folders or read unrelated references.
```

- **Live data validation:** When any issue involves external data sources (APIs, databases, services), include in the Scout prompt: *"Public/anonymous HTTP validation uses WebFetch. Authenticated/private read-only checks use verified-safe Bash helper scripts or curl wrappers after preflight. Do not run unsafe or mutating checks. Defer those to Dev/Debugger. When live validation runs or is deferred, include `## Live Validation Evidence` with `command_shape`, `exit_status`, `redacted_evidence`, `expected_shape`, `confidence`, and `limitations_or_deferred_reason`."*
- After Scout completes, validate the exact research artifact before advancing:
  - If Scout returns a no-tool/tool-provisioning failure, apply the circuit breaker above before running validation.
  ```bash
  bash /tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/scripts/validate-uat-remediation-artifact.sh research "{round_dir}/R{RR}-RESEARCH.md"
  ```
  If validation fails, display the validator error and STOP without advancing state. Do not search for an alternate RESEARCH.md.
- Then advance:
  ```bash
  bash /tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/scripts/uat-remediation-state.sh advance "$PHASE_DIR"
  ```
- Then continue to the next stage (`plan`).

## Plan Stage (VIBE-UAT-04)

If `plan_path` from step 4 is non-empty, the plan was already written in a previous session, do NOT re-plan. Validate it, read the existing plan, and advance directly to `execute`:
```bash
bash /tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/scripts/validate-uat-remediation-artifact.sh plan "{plan_path}"
```
If validation fails, display the validator error and STOP without advancing state. If validation succeeds, read the existing plan and advance directly to `execute`.

If `plan_path` is empty, spawn Lead as a **single subagent** to write the remediation plan.

**NO team creation (NON-NEGOTIABLE).** Do not form an agent team (do not spawn teammates). Use plain sequential subagent Agent calls, remediation planning spawns Lead directly via Agent tool.

Non-team invariant: omit `team_name`, `run_in_background`, `isolation`, and all worktree cwd fields.

This is NOT "Plan mode steps 1-12", remediation has its own sequential flow that does not use the standard planning pipeline.

- Resolve Lead model:
  ```bash
  if ! AGENT_SETTINGS=$(bash /tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/scripts/resolve-agent-settings.sh lead .vbw-planning/config.json /tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/config/model-profiles.json "{effort}"); then
    echo "$AGENT_SETTINGS" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
  eval "$AGENT_SETTINGS"
  LEAD_MODEL="$RESOLVED_MODEL"
  LEAD_MAX_TURNS="$RESOLVED_MAX_TURNS"
  LEAD_REASONING="$RESOLVED_REASONING"
  ```
- Before composing the Lead task description, evaluate installed skills visible in your system context, read each skill's description and select only skills directly needed to write the remediation plan. Do not preselect implementation-heavy skills such as SwiftData, SwiftUI, XcodeBuildMCP, database, or accessibility skills unless the planning task itself requires that documentation to produce correct tasks. Instead, record recommended Dev-stage skills in the plan when implementation work will need them. The Lead prompt MUST begin with exactly one explicit skill outcome block: use `<skill_activation>{For each selected skill: "Call Skill({skill-name})"}</skill_activation>` when one or more installed skills are preselected at orchestration time, or `<skill_no_activation>Evaluated installed skills for this task. No skills were preselected at orchestration time. Reason: {brief task-specific reason}.</skill_no_activation>` when none are preselected. Silent omission of both blocks is invalid. After evaluating, state the skill outcome in your response (e.g., "Skills: activating {skill-name}" or "Skills: none preselected, {reason}") so the user has visibility before the agent is spawned. After calling `Skill(...)`, if the loaded skill's instructions reference additional files, sibling docs, or follow-up read steps relevant to the active task, read those specific files before reasoning or acting. Do not scan entire skill folders or read unrelated references.
- If one or more skills were preselected, run `bash "{plugin-root}/scripts/extract-skill-follow-up-files.sh" "{all preselected skill names from the activation block}" 2>/dev/null || true` before spawning the UAT remediation Lead. If the helper prints a `<skill_follow_up_files>` block, paste it immediately after the follow-up-read sentence in the spawned payload. Otherwise omit that block.
- Use this payload prefix as the FIRST lines of the UAT remediation Lead prompt:
  ```text
  <skill_activation>
  Call Skill('{relevant-skill-1}').
  Call Skill('{relevant-skill-2}').
  </skill_activation>
  After calling `Skill(...)`, if the loaded skill's instructions reference additional files, sibling docs, or follow-up read steps relevant to the active task, read those specific files before reasoning or acting. Do not scan entire skill folders or read unrelated references.
  <skill_follow_up_files>
  {If one or more skills were preselected, run `bash "{plugin-root}/scripts/extract-skill-follow-up-files.sh" "{all preselected skill names from the activation block}" 2>/dev/null || true` before spawning and replace this block with the emitted absolute follow-up file paths. Omit this block when the helper prints nothing.}
  </skill_follow_up_files>
  ```
  When no installed skills apply, use this prefix instead:
  ```text
  <skill_no_activation>
  Evaluated installed skills for this task. No skills were preselected at orchestration time. Reason: {brief task-specific reason}.
  </skill_no_activation>
  After calling `Skill(...)`, if the loaded skill's instructions reference additional files, sibling docs, or follow-up read steps relevant to the active task, read those specific files before reasoning or acting. Do not scan entire skill folders or read unrelated references.
  ```
- Also evaluate available MCP tools in your system context. If any MCP servers provide capabilities relevant to this planning task, use them to derive concise facts, docs, results, or recommended Dev-stage CLIs/skills for the Lead's task context. Dev subagents may call any MCP tools available in their runtime. No orchestrator-side gating is required.
- Spawn vbw-lead via Agent tool: Set `subagent_type: "vbw:vbw-lead"` and `model: "${LEAD_MODEL}"`. If `LEAD_MAX_TURNS` is non-empty, also pass `maxTurns: ${LEAD_MAX_TURNS}`. If empty, omit maxTurns. If `LEAD_REASONING` is non-empty, also pass `effort: "${LEAD_REASONING}"`. If `LEAD_REASONING` is empty, do NOT include effort (the resolved model rejects the parameter).
- Lead prompt MUST include:
  - If `research_path` from step 4 is non-empty: `Read {research_path} for full research findings before planning.` (Lead must read the file, do NOT inline a summary.)
  - The priority-ranked issue list from step 5 with recurring-issue annotations.
  - `"Read the remediation plan template at /tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/templates/REMEDIATION-PLAN.md and follow its structure exactly. This template is different from the regular PLAN.md, it has no wave or depends_on fields because remediation tasks are always sequential. Produce a flat ordered task list where each task can see the results of previous tasks."` (Lead must read the template file.)
  - Output path: `{round_dir}/R{RR}-PLAN.md` (using `round` from step 4 as `{RR}` and the absolute `round_dir` from step 4).
- Display `◆ Spawning Lead agent...` → `✓ Lead agent complete`.
- If Lead returns a no-tool/tool-provisioning failure, apply the circuit breaker above before normalizing or validating the plan.
- Normalize plan filenames:
  ```bash
  NORM_SCRIPT="/tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/scripts/normalize-plan-filenames.sh"
  if [ -f "$NORM_SCRIPT" ]; then
    bash "$NORM_SCRIPT" "{round_dir}"
  fi
  ```
- Validate the exact plan artifact before advancing:
  ```bash
  bash /tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/scripts/validate-uat-remediation-artifact.sh plan "{round_dir}/R{RR}-PLAN.md"
  ```
  If validation fails, display the validator error and STOP without advancing state. Do not search for an alternate PLAN.md.
- After planning completes, advance:
  ```bash
  bash /tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/scripts/uat-remediation-state.sh advance "$PHASE_DIR"
  ```

Then continue to the next stage (`execute`), respecting autonomy confirmation rules.

## Execute Stage (VIBE-UAT-05)

Execute the remediation plan by spawning Dev agents sequentially, one per task in the plan. Do NOT use "normal Execute flow" or `execute-protocol.md`, remediation execution is self-contained with no wave parallelism.

**NO team creation (NON-NEGOTIABLE).** Do not form an agent team (do not spawn teammates). Use plain sequential subagent Agent calls, remediation execution spawns Dev agents directly via Agent tool.

Non-team invariant: omit `team_name`, `run_in_background`, `isolation`, and all worktree cwd fields.

- Read `plan_path` when it is non-empty. Otherwise read `{round_dir}/R{RR}-PLAN.md` (using `round` and the absolute `round_dir` from step 4). Extract the task list from the plan frontmatter/body. Each task has an ID (e.g., `P07`, `P08`, `UAT-3`).
- Resolve Dev model:
  ```bash
  if ! AGENT_SETTINGS=$(bash /tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/scripts/resolve-agent-settings.sh dev .vbw-planning/config.json /tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/config/model-profiles.json "{effort}"); then
    echo "$AGENT_SETTINGS" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
  eval "$AGENT_SETTINGS"
  DEV_MODEL="$RESOLVED_MODEL"
  DEV_MAX_TURNS="$RESOLVED_MAX_TURNS"
  DEV_REASONING="$RESOLVED_REASONING"
  ```
- Before composing Dev task descriptions, evaluate installed skills visible in your system context, read each skill's description and select the task-specific skills listed in the remediation plan plus any directly required build, test, documentation, or domain skills for the current task. Do not carry over broad Scout/Lead context or activate skills for unrelated future tasks. The Dev prompt MUST begin with exactly one explicit skill outcome block: use `<skill_activation>{For each selected skill: "Call Skill({skill-name})"}</skill_activation>` when one or more installed skills are preselected at orchestration time, or `<skill_no_activation>Evaluated installed skills for this task. No skills were preselected at orchestration time. Reason: {brief task-specific reason}.</skill_no_activation>` when none are preselected. Silent omission of both blocks is invalid. After evaluating, state the skill outcome in your response (e.g., "Skills: activating {skill-name}" or "Skills: none preselected, {reason}") so the user has visibility before the agent is spawned. After calling `Skill(...)`, if the loaded skill's instructions reference additional files, sibling docs, or follow-up read steps relevant to the active task, read those specific files before reasoning or acting. Do not scan entire skill folders or read unrelated references.
- If one or more skills were preselected, run `bash "{plugin-root}/scripts/extract-skill-follow-up-files.sh" "{all preselected skill names from the activation block}" 2>/dev/null || true` before spawning the UAT remediation Dev. If the helper prints a `<skill_follow_up_files>` block, paste it immediately after the follow-up-read sentence in the spawned payload. Otherwise omit that block.
- Use this payload prefix as the FIRST lines of the UAT remediation Dev prompt:
  ```text
  <skill_activation>
  Call Skill('{relevant-skill-1}').
  Call Skill('{relevant-skill-2}').
  </skill_activation>
  After calling `Skill(...)`, if the loaded skill's instructions reference additional files, sibling docs, or follow-up read steps relevant to the active task, read those specific files before reasoning or acting. Do not scan entire skill folders or read unrelated references.
  <skill_follow_up_files>
  {If one or more skills were preselected, run `bash "{plugin-root}/scripts/extract-skill-follow-up-files.sh" "{all preselected skill names from the activation block}" 2>/dev/null || true` before spawning and replace this block with the emitted absolute follow-up file paths. Omit this block when the helper prints nothing.}
  </skill_follow_up_files>
  ```
  When no installed skills apply, use this prefix instead:
  ```text
  <skill_no_activation>
  Evaluated installed skills for this task. No skills were preselected at orchestration time. Reason: {brief task-specific reason}.
  </skill_no_activation>
  After calling `Skill(...)`, if the loaded skill's instructions reference additional files, sibling docs, or follow-up read steps relevant to the active task, read those specific files before reasoning or acting. Do not scan entire skill folders or read unrelated references.
  ```
- For each task in the plan (**sequentially**, one at a time, wait for each Dev to complete before spawning the next):
  - Spawn vbw-dev via Agent tool: Set `subagent_type: "vbw:vbw-dev"` and `model: "${DEV_MODEL}"`. If `DEV_MAX_TURNS` is non-empty, also pass `maxTurns: ${DEV_MAX_TURNS}`. If empty, omit maxTurns. If `DEV_REASONING` is non-empty, also pass `effort: "${DEV_REASONING}"`. If `DEV_REASONING` is empty, do NOT include effort (the resolved model rejects the parameter).
  - Dev prompt MUST include:
    - The task details from the plan (description, files to modify, acceptance criteria).
    - `"Read the remediation summary template at /tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/templates/REMEDIATION-SUMMARY.md and follow its structure for your task section."` For the **first task only**, also include: `"Create {summary_path} with the YAML frontmatter from the template (populate phase, round, title from the plan. Set status to in-progress, tasks_completed to 0, tasks_total to {total}) followed by your ## Task {N}: {name} section."` For **subsequent tasks**, include: `"Append your ## Task {N}: {name} section to {summary_path}. Do NOT rewrite the frontmatter or earlier task sections. Do NOT leave trailing blank lines after your section."`
    - `"Use the absolute host-repository artifact paths in this prompt exactly. Claude may execute from .claude/worktrees/agent-* sidechain CWDs. Do not rewrite artifact paths relative to the current CWD or create remediation artifacts inside the sidechain."`
    - If `.vbw-planning/codebase/META.md` exists: `"Read CONVENTIONS.md, PATTERNS.md, STRUCTURE.md, and DEPENDENCIES.md (whichever exist) from .vbw-planning/codebase/ to bootstrap codebase understanding before executing."`
  - Display: `◆ Spawning Dev agent for task {task-id} (${DEV_MODEL})...` → `✓ Dev agent complete for task {task-id}`.
  - If Dev returns a no-tool/tool-provisioning failure for the task, apply the circuit breaker above before spawning another Dev, finalizing `{summary_path}`, or advancing state.
- **Frontmatter finalization:** After ALL Dev agents have completed, update the YAML frontmatter in `{summary_path}`: set `status` to `complete` (or `partial`/`failed`), `completed` to today's date, `tasks_completed` to the actual count, and populate `commit_hashes`, `files_modified`, and `deviations` with aggregate data from all task sections. Strip any trailing blank lines from the file.
- **Summary validation:** Validate the exact summary artifact before advancing:
  ```bash
  bash /tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/scripts/validate-uat-remediation-artifact.sh summary "{summary_path}"
  ```
  If validation fails, display the validator error and STOP without advancing state. Do not search for an alternate SUMMARY.md.
- **Worktree cleanup check:** After execution, check for orphan CC worktrees:
  ```bash
  if [ -d ".claude/worktrees" ] && [ -n "$(ls -A .claude/worktrees 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
    echo "⚠ Found CC worktrees at .claude/worktrees/, run 'git worktree list' and 'git worktree remove <path>' to clean up"
  fi
  ```
  Display this warning to the user if worktrees are found. Do NOT auto-delete them.
- Advance:
  ```bash
  bash /tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/scripts/uat-remediation-state.sh advance "$PHASE_DIR"
  ```
- **Chain into re-verification (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** After the execute stage advances to `done`, the remediation round is complete but NOT verified. Immediately prepare for re-verification and chain into Verify mode in the same turn:
  - Run: `bash /tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/scripts/prepare-reverification.sh "$PHASE_DIR"`
  - **Error guard:** If the script fails (non-zero exit), display the error message and **STOP**, do not attempt to enter Verify mode with stale/missing context.
  - Parse output: `archived=kept|in-round-dir|<original-uat-basename>`, `skipped=already_archived|ready_for_verify|cap_reached`, `round_file=...`, `phase=NN`, `layout=...`
  - If `skipped=cap_reached`: display the same UAT remediation cap banner as the top-level re-verification flow and STOP. Use `max_rounds={N}` from the script output.
  - If `archived=kept`: display "Phase UAT preserved. Starting re-verification in round dir."
    If `skipped=ready_for_verify`: display "Round {NN} remediation complete. Starting re-verification."
    If `skipped=already_archived`: display "UAT already archived. Starting re-verification."
    Otherwise: display "Archived previous UAT → {round_file}. Starting re-verification."
  - Planning artifact boundary commit (conditional):
    ```bash
    PG_SCRIPT="/tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/scripts/planning-git.sh"
    if [ -f "$PG_SCRIPT" ]; then
      bash "$PG_SCRIPT" commit-boundary "execute phase {NN} remediation round {RR}" .vbw-planning/config.json
    else
      echo "⚠ VBW: planning-git.sh unavailable. Skipping planning git boundary commit." >&2
    fi
    ```
  - **Continue directly into Verify mode** for this phase, do NOT stop, do NOT tell the user to run `/vbw:vibe`. Enter Verify mode (below) inline in the same turn. The pre-computed verify context may be stale (it was computed at session start, before remediation). Re-compute it:
    ```bash
    bash /tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/scripts/compile-verify-context-for-uat.sh "$PHASE_DIR"
    ```
    **uat_path validation (defense-in-depth):** After parsing the fresh verify context, validate that `uat_path` already points at the current remediation round's round-scoped UAT path (`remediation/uat/round-{RR}/R{RR}-UAT.md` for round-dir layout, `remediation/round-{RR}/R{RR}-UAT.md` for legacy layout). If it does not (e.g., it points to the phase-root UAT like `03-UAT.md`), override it with the round-scoped path for the current round from `uat-remediation-state.sh`. This prevents the original phase-root UAT from being overwritten during re-verification.
    Use this fresh verify context for the Verify mode CHECKPOINT loop.
  Do NOT present the remediation summary and stop, the summary is only useful if the session cannot continue (e.g., compaction).

## Fix Stage (VIBE-UAT-06)

Route to a quick-fix implementation path for the same phase using the normalized issue list from step 3 (with step-5 recurrence annotations when available) as task input (equivalent to `/vbw:fix`, but without requiring the user to invoke it manually). After changes, advance:

Apply the no-tool circuit breaker in `references/subagent-contracts.md` to the quick-fix Dev return before the advance below. If it triggers, STOP without advancing `.uat-remediation-stage`, report the failed Dev quick-fix task, and do not enter re-verification.

No-tool invariant: treat unavailable tools as a provisioning failure, do not advance state, and do not retry the same prompt.

```bash
bash /tmp/.vbw-plugin-root-link-${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-default}/scripts/uat-remediation-state.sh advance "$PHASE_DIR"
```

Then chain into re-verification using the same steps as the execute stage above (prepare-reverification → commit boundary → Verify mode inline). Do NOT suggest `/vbw:vibe`, enter Verify mode in the same turn.

## Fallback Remediation Summary (VIBE-UAT-07)

Only when re-verification chaining could not complete in this turn, e.g., context window limits, compaction, or session interruption, present a remediation summary with: phase, issue count, severity mix, current stage, chosen path (`research -> plan -> execute` or quick-fix), and per-test recurrence. For any issue with `failure_count >= 2`, include: `"⚠ RECURRING ({failure_count}/{round} rounds): {ID}, {DESCRIPTION}"`. First-time failures display without the annotation. End with: "Run `/vbw:vibe` to start re-verification."
