# Executional Abstraction and the Role of Programming Languages

How a single compact argument can certify millions of possible computations, and what that demands of the notation we program in. **Source:** A Discipline of Programming, Foreword, Preface, Ch 0 "Executional Abstraction", Ch 1 "The Role of Programming Languages".

## TL;DR

- An algorithm is not one computation. It is the design of a whole class of computations, and its value is that one short argument covers every member of the class.
- Executional abstraction means gripping a specific computation by treating it as an instance of a well-chosen class, then reasoning about the class as a whole.
- Generalization carries two obligations: define the class explicitly (the argument must apply to all of it), and choose a generalization that actually helps (a "GCD computer" beats a "111-and-259 processor").
- The correctness argument for Euclid's game has exactly three parts: a relation kept invariant by every step, an interpretation of the final state as the answer, and a proof that a final state is reached in finitely many steps. Each argument has length independent of the number of possible computations.
- State spaces are built as Cartesian products of small variable spaces. Components add, states multiply. This exponential growth is only legitimate while the justifying argument stays compact.
- A program text admits two complementary readings: as a code for a predicate transformer (for the human, connecting initial and final states without mentioning execution) and as executable code (for the machine). Correctness concerns and efficiency concerns separate along this line.
- A programming language is first a vehicle for describing abstract mechanisms, and only accidentally something a computer can execute. Judge a language feature by whether it belongs to the solution set or the problem set.
- Nondeterminacy is the normal situation. Determinacy is a special case, and much past trouble came from attaching undue significance to it.

## When to reach for this

- You are about to solve a specific instance (one input, one configuration, one customer) and must decide what class of inputs the code should be written and argued for.
- You need to convince a reviewer a routine is correct without exhaustive testing, and want the invariant, answer, termination proof shape.
- You are evaluating a framework, language feature, or DSL and want a principled criterion beyond familiarity or benchmark speed.
- A design's state space is exploding (feature flags, config combinations) and you must judge whether the justifying argument still scales.
- You are tempted to contort clear structure for performance on one platform, and need the argument for blaming the implementation instead.

## Key concepts

### From answers to rules of a game

Dijkstra builds a ladder of GCD "machines". A card printed with "GCD(111, 259) = 37" answers one question, and you can only trust the manufacturer. A lookup table of 250,000 entries answers 250,000 questions, but multiplies the required faith by 250,000: verification effort grows with the number of answers. The breakthrough machine stores no answers at all. It is a board plus a pebble plus rules for moving the pebble (each move replaces (x, y) by (x, y-x) or by (x-y, y), stopping on the line x = y). Now a single short argument about the rules certifies every one of the 250,000 possible games. The price is that each answer must be computed by playing the game rather than looked up. That trade, compact justification bought at the cost of execution time, is the essence of what an algorithm is. It also explains, in one stroke, why short programs can run long and why we want fast machines.

### The three-part correctness argument

Trust in the pebble machine rests on three theorems, each proved once for all cases:

1. Invariance. Every legal move preserves GCD(x, y) = GCD(X, Y), where (X, Y) is the starting position. One argument covers all 249,500 movable positions.
2. Interpretation of the final state. On the stopping line x = y, GCD(x, y) = x, so the coordinate read off is the answer. One argument covers all 500 stopping points.
3. Termination. From any start, finitely many moves reach the stopping line. One argument covers all 250,000 starts.

This is the invariant, postcondition, variant pattern of the whole book in embryo, exhibited before any formal machinery exists. The repetition itself is captured by a device worth naming: the rules do not enumerate "do this, do that" but give a single step plus the condition for repeating it (repeat until the step is undefined). One sub-rule, applied repeatedly, generates every game.

### State spaces as Cartesian products

The single pebble with 250,000 positions can be split into two half-pebbles with 500 positions each: the total state space is the Cartesian product of the state spaces of the variables x and y. This is why registers work. Components with modest state counts multiply into astronomical total state counts (the decimal number system is the ten-century-old proof: digits grow with the logarithm of the largest number represented). Dijkstra's warning is the load-bearing part: you may keep multiplying the state space only while the argument justifying the whole contraption stays compact. The moment the argument grows exponentially too, the machine is not worth designing. Systematic structure is also a precondition, since a "shapeless, chaotic cloud of points" with no nomenclature supports no compact rules.

### Helpful generalization

Saying "everything is an instance of something more general" is empty. A useful generalization is chosen, almost invented, against two obligations: be explicit about what the wider class is, and pick a class the argument can actually exploit. The GCD computer (one function, any input pair) verifies easily. The 111-and-259 processor (any function, one input pair) gets harder to verify with every function added. When you generalize code, generalize along the axis that keeps verification cheap.

### Two readings of one program text

The preface records the discovery that drives the rest of the book. Predicate transformers let one define the relation between initial and final state with no reference to intermediate states, so the same text can be read two ways: as a code for a predicate transformer (the reading suited to humans, carrying the mathematical correctness concerns) and as executable code (a reading best left to machines, where efficiency lives, and efficiency is only defined relative to an implementation). This separation of concerns is the book's central message. Two consequences follow. First, the natural systematic codes for predicate transformers call for nondeterministic execution, so nondeterminacy becomes the normal case and determinacy an unremarkable special case. Second, explicit concern for termination has heuristic value, against the common bias toward partial correctness.

### What a programming language is for

Chapter 1 gives three payoffs of formal notation: it presents each algorithm as a member of a huge describable class, it makes algorithms mathematical objects about which theorems can be proved (for instance from shared structural properties), and it removes all ambiguity about what output belongs to what input, which is what makes automatic execution conceivable at all. Historically the last payoff dominated: execution efficiency on existing machines became the major quality criterion, and machine anomalies were "truthfully reflected" into languages at the expense of intellectual manageability. Dijkstra inverts the priority. A language is primarily a vehicle for describing abstract mechanisms. Executability is a lucky accident. His example: advising PL/I programmers to avoid procedure calls because they are inefficient attacks the language's main structuring vehicle. Blame the inadequate implementation, do not raise it to a standard. The same logic explains the book's deliberately small mini-language, chosen by asking of every facility whether it belongs to the solution set or the problem set, and his preference for repetition over general recursion: repetition needs only a recurrence relation between predicates, general recursion needs one between predicate transformers, an order of magnitude more complicated, a sledgehammer for an egg.

## Applying it in modern code

- Before coding a specific case, name the class you are solving and write it down (types, docstring, property test domain). Then make sure your reasoning covers the whole class, not the example that prompted the ticket.
- Structure every nontrivial loop so the three-part argument is visible: a stated invariant (comment or assertion), a clear reading of why the exit state is the answer, and a measure that strictly decreases (the variant). If you cannot state all three, the loop is a conjecture.
- Treat configuration flags, optional fields, and mode enums as state space multipliers. Add one only if the justifying argument (tests, invariants, docs) stays roughly the same size.
- When choosing a generalization, prefer the "GCD computer" axis: one behavior over a wide input class, not many behaviors over a narrow one. God objects and kitchen-sink services are 111-and-259 processors.
- Read your code twice: once as a specification of the input-output relation (would this survive as a property-based test oracle?), once as an execution plan (is it efficient on the real runtime?). Keep the concerns in separate discussions and separate commits where possible.
- When a clean construct is slow on your platform, fix or replace the implementation before deforming the code. Do not encode a runtime's anomaly into your architecture.
- Where several execution orders are all correct, say so (iteration over sets, concurrent tasks, retry order) instead of letting callers depend on one accidental order. Overcommitting to determinacy manufactures future coupling.
- Never trust an artifact you can only verify answer by answer (a lookup table, a generated blob, a trained model's outputs). Prefer artifacts with compact rules you can argue about once, and where you cannot, invest in verification machinery instead of faith in the manufacturer.

## Pitfalls

- Testing instances and calling it correctness. A test suite is a finite table of checked answers, the argument-per-answer trap. Only an invariant-style argument covers the class. (Dijkstra: none of the programs in the book was ever tested on a machine.)
- Generalizing along the wrong axis, adding features to one component until its verification cost explodes, instead of widening the input class of one behavior.
- Growing the state space without growing the argument. Every unconstrained flag combination is a position on the board that no theorem covers.
- Judging languages and abstractions purely by execution efficiency, then avoiding their structuring constructs (procedures, iterators, higher-order functions) because one implementation is slow.
- Equating "harder to write down" with "the method made it hard". Making the difficulty visible is the point. The alternative is smearing code: texts with the status of hardly supported conjectures waiting to be killed by the first counterexample.
- Reaching for the most powerful construct available (general recursion, full metaprogramming) when a weaker one (plain repetition) admits a simpler semantic argument.
